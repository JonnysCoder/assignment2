2.) There have been 9 commits
    The command used was: git rev-list --count HEAD


3.) Date:   Fri Feb 28 23:40:56 2025 -0600
    The command used was: git log -1 README.md

4.) It isolates changes safely and enables parallel devlopment

5.) git log displays the commit history where as git status shows the working 
    tree aka describing which files are modified, unstaged, or untracked.

6.) git log -- Vehicle.h

7.) git log --grep="file"

8.) I) Inheritance is where one class acquires the properties of another class
    II) Polymorphism allows a single interface to be used for different 
        implementaions
    III) Encapsulation bundles data and the methods that use the data together
         in a class and also restricts data access to some components

9.) The main difference is that Dictator/Lieutenant workflow splits up the work
    in a tiered higharchy where as Integration Manager workflow makes the 
    manager do all the integration.

10.) They would benefit because the Dicatators and Liuetenants workflow
     allows a scalable model for a large team. Since the team is so large
     many lieutenants can be appointed and the code can be smoothly integrated
